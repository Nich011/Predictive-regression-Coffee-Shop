# Regression model: Coffee Shop Sales â˜•
A project using Azure Machine Learning to predict sales, improve profit, stock management and reduce losses.

### The aim of this project is to consolidate and utilize explored concepts and Knowledge in order to build a real, practical project in Machine Learning.

The process includes collecting and preparing data, selecting suitable machine learning algorithms (such as regression or supervised learning methods), and training the model. After training, the model is evaluated using performance metrics and then deployed to generate real-time predictions. Data analytics tools, machine learning frameworks, and cloud deployment services are used to ensure that the solution is scalable and efficient. As such, the Technical Goals are:

#### âœ… Train a Machine Learning model to predict sales based on the temperature of the day.
#### âœ… Register and manage the model using MLflow.
#### âœ… Deploy the model for real-time predictions in a Cloud Computing environment, using Microsoft Azure.
#### âœ… Create a structured pipeline to ensure reproducibility and facilitate maintenance by the entire team involved.

# Business Context ðŸ’¡
CafÃ© Aurora is a local coffee shop that experiences fluctuations in sales depending on the weather, especially temperature. On colder days, hot drinks are in higher demand, while on warmer days, iced beverages and foot traffic vary significantly.

Local coffee shops rely heavily on daily demand:

#### They work with perishable products (milk, sweets, ground grains).

#### A large part of the production is done on the same day, requiring demand forecasting.

Based on the observation that the amount of coffee sold daily has a strong correlation with the ambient temperature, the coffee shop owners decided to look for a way to predict how much will be sold, in order to plan accordingly.
The goal is to build a simple yet effective predictive model that estimates how many coffees will be sold on a given day, based on the forecasted temperature. This enables better preparation and decision-making.

| Benefit                           | Impact                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smarter inventory planning**    | Reduce waste by preparing the right amount of fresh ingredients (milk, fruits, bakery items) |
| **Optimized staffing**            | Avoid overstaffing or understaffing by predicting busy days                                  |
| **Efficient product preparation** | Prepare drinks and pastries in advance based on expected demand                              |
| **Weather-based promotions**      | Trigger automated discounts or ads (e.g., iced coffee discounts on hot days)                 |
| **Higher profit margins**         | Lower losses from unsold stock and improve resource utilization                              |
| **Improved customer experience**  | Shorter wait times, better service, and fewer stockouts                                      |
